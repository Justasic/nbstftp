// The No bullshit config file for the No bullshit TFTP server!
//
// This file is pretty simple, one block (so far) with a few
// configuration lines.
//
// Single line comments are supported as C++ style "//"
// Multi-line comments are supported as C-style "/* */"
// blocks (eg, parts which look like "blah { ... }") do not require semi-colons
// but their contents do. See below to know what the hell I am talking about.

// Server configuration

        //port = 69;
