{"name":"The No Bullshit TFTP server","tagline":"Taking the Bullshit out of TFTP","body":"NBSTFTP\r\n=======\r\n\r\nThe No Bullshit TFTP server. I started this project because of my constant frustration with other\r\nTFTP server implementations which require an obscene number of steps for a simple protocol. The\r\nservers expected some kind of special folder that had a magical permission number with a special\r\nuser and group which were configured in files that are in non-standard locations.\r\nThey called it the \"Trivial\" file transfer protocol but the only trivial part about it is the\r\nactual protocol, I intend to fix that with this project.\r\n\r\n\r\nNBSTFTP does not use xinetd or any of that garbage. It is a lightweight TFTP implementation which\r\nreads a config file from /etc/ (unless otherwise specified) and serves files from a configured\r\ndirectory. Setup should take no more than 5 minutes at max.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
